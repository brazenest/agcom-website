			<p>Whether I’m engineering a product or producing a video, my philosophy stays the same: <strong>clarity over complexity, craft over shortcuts, and emotion over decoration</strong>. Code should feel as intentional as narrative editing. <strong></strong>Interfaces should have rhythm. Great experiences — whether interactive or cinematic — are invisible when they work and unforgettable when well-designed.</p>

			<p>Today, I focus on bridging those worlds for companies and creatives who value <strong>high-quality work that doesn’t feel templated or generic</strong>. I architect and design full-stack web experiences using technologies like <strong>TypeScript, React, Next.js, Node, Tailwind, and AWS</strong> — and I create visual content using the language of film: <strong>camera, color, composition, and pacing</strong>.</p>

			<p>In every project, I bring both sides of my brain: the engineer who builds systems that scale, and the filmmaker who knows how to make people care.</p>
