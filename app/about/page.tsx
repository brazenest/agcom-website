					<p className="mb-4">As a young student of creativity, I studied <strong>Computer Science</strong> at the University of Florida and subsequently earned a <strong>Film & Video Production</strong> degree from Full Sail University. Those two identities collided early in my life and have never separated.</p>
					<p className="mb-4">I’ve worked as a full-stack engineer on <strong>high-visibility, high-impact projects</strong> including a consumer-scale onboarding flow used by millions annually. I’ve also spent years shooting, editing, and producing videos designed to communicate ideas visually, memorably, and at a professional level. My YouTube channel has been enjoyed by <strong>over 260,000 viewers.</strong></p>



					<p className="mb-4">
						As a full-stack software engineer and video producer, <strong>I thrive on the intersection of technology and creativity.</strong> My journey is marked by a dual-role approach, where I blend my technical skills with my creative flair to deliver impactful solutions.

						With a background in both software engineering and video production, I bring a unique perspective to my work. <strong>I am passionate about creating digital experiences</strong> that not only meet technical requirements but also captivate audiences through compelling design and storytelling.

							<p>Whether I’m engineering a product or producing a video, my philosophy stays the same: <strong>clarity over complexity, craft over shortcuts, and emotion over decoration.</strong> Code should feel as intentional as narrative editing. Interfaces should have rhythm. Great experiences — whether interactive or cinematic — are invisible when they work and unforgettable when they’re well-designed.</p>

							<p>I believe the best digital products feel less like software and more like stories you move through. <strong>Every transition, every interaction, every frame should serve a purpose.</strong> Just like in film, pacing and structure matter. What you choose not to include matters just as much as what you do. My goal is always to remove friction, reduce cognitive load<strong></strong>, and let people focus on what they came for.</p>

							<p>Today, I bridge those worlds<strong></strong> for companies and creatives who value high-quality work that doesn’t feel templated or generic. I architect and design full-stack web experiences using <strong>TypeScript, React, Next.js, Node, Tailwind, and AWS</strong> — building systems that are scalable, maintainable, and designed to evolve. I care about design systems, performance, accessibility, and long-term maintainability, not just shipping something that works today.</p>

							<p>At the same time, I create visual content using the <strong>language of film: camera, color, composition, light, and pacing.</strong> I think in terms of shots and emotional beats — how visuals guide attention and how subtle motion communicates meaning. Whether I’m behind a camera or a code editor, I’m always thinking about how people feel while experiencing what I’ve built.</p>

							<p>I don’t see design, engineering, and storytelling as separate disciplines, but as parts of the same system. <strong>Strategy informs structure.</strong> Structure informs visuals. Visuals reinforce meaning — and meaning is what people remember.</p>

							<p>In every project, <strong>I bring both sides of my brain</strong>: the engineer who builds systems that scale, and the filmmaker who knows how to make people care. I build for impact<strong></strong> — not just technical success, but emotional resonance — because the best products don’t just solve problems, they create connection.</p>
