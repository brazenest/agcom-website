# Home Page

## Intent

To be a marketing-focused page to motivate visitors to learn about me through perusal of my work and my self-description, instead of them bouncing to someone else.

## Sections

### Hero

Pattern: Centered Hero CTA.

#### Purpose

To introduce myself to the visitor, visually and textually, immediately presenting them with my primary value proposition and my primary keywords highly visible to them and search engines.

My profile image provides them a mental image of my demographics and a first impression of my personality.

Two CTAs exist, each directing the visitor's attention toward main information:
* the primary CTA, to view my work
* the secondary CTA, to learn more about me vis-a-vis my background and qualifications.

### Dual Talent Summary

Pattern: Split Emphasis.

#### Purpose

To offer a description of my primary value proposition, as a professional engaged in dual roles: an engineer and a creative storyteller.

Each role introduction is effectively a summary of the formal page for that role. It gives just enough to prompt the question, "Are you looking for someone to fill this role?"

The summary information concludes with a CTA, which points to the formal role page.

### Social Activity: Blog Posts

Pattern: Asymmetric Content Grid.

#### Purpose

To express my ability to write and express ideas in long-form prose, as it provides examples of my dual-role ability as both an engineer and a creative storyteller. Additionally, it shows my determination to conduct self-promotion and display my marketing talent.

The blog posts aren't focused exclusively on engineering topics, though they dovetail as engineering is my main realm of focus. It includes my work as an activist for The Mirage Volcano, my service in the UF Student Government, and miscellaneous topics of personal interest -- such as photography and artistic events -- not necessarily as an engineer or a creative storyteller but as a reviewer of the path I've taken to become the creative storytelling engineer I am today.

### Social Activity: Social Media Accounts

Pattern: Dense Infostrip.

#### Purpose

To provide links to my social media accounts, where I engage in further self-promotion and marketing of my dual-role ability as both an engineer and a creative storyteller.

It doesn't elaborate, as I haven't utilized much of social media in any given account. It rather gives the visitor some external content to explore.

Prominent links are to my profiles:
* Primary: LinkedIn, GitHub, Dribbble
* Secondary: X/Twitter, 500px, Steam/C:S

### Closing CTA

Pattern: Terminal Resolve.

#### Purpose

To provide a final nudge to the visitor to take action, either to view my work or to contact me directly, rather than bounce elsewhere.
